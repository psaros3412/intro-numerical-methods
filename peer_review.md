# Peer Review Guidelines

When writing a peer review give the code a look over and think about the questions below.  Giving a couple of sentences for each of the questions is sufficient.  Code examples are even better!

1. Easy to read and understand?
   - Doc-strings are clear and accurate (and present)
   - Variables and functions are named descriptively when useful
   - Comments are placed in appropriate places and are clear and accurate
1. Does the code follow a consistent style?
   - [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) or other style is consistent
   - Indentation is clean and not mixed
1. Is the code written succinctly and efficiently?
   - Was there superfluous code sections?
   - Could the sections of code be written more clearly or more elegantly without decreasing readability?
   
Make sure to suggest **constructive** ways to improve all of the above along with:
 - Clever ways to use built-in functionality (when appropriate)
 - Simpler ways to implent the same functionality
 - General improvements to structure, style, and naming
